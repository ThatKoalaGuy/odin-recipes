        Lasagna also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide,
        flat sheets.
    </p>

    <p>
    The assembled lasagna sholid take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover
    it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's
    important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that 
    it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover
    the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through
    and the sauce is bubbly.
