    Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, 
    fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably 
    already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
    </p>

    <p>
    Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and 
    the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.
    </p>

    <p>
    Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. Refrain from adding 
    toppings (such as syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.
