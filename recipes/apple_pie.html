    This recipe calls for Granny Smith apples for a couple reasons: Their firmness means they will
    hold their shape during cooking and their tart flavor perfectly balances out the sweetness of
    the sugar. Some bakers prefer using Granny Smith apples in combination with a slightly sweeter
    variety, such as Honeycrisp.

    You'll bake the pie at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then you'll reduce the temperature to 350
    degrees F and continue baking for 35-45 minutes. All in all, the pie will bake for about one hour,
    give or take a few minutes. You'll know the pie is done when the apples are soft and the crust
    is a beautiful golden brown color.
